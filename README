RihDB

A "Rust" re-implementation of my (not released) "not-invented-here" DB.

A work in progress.  Run "cargo test".

Its license right now is AGPLv3-only, because I don't feel like thinking about
it.  If you ask nicely, I might change it.

Right now this is a very simple LSM-tree storage library.  It doesn't cache any
data in memory, reads way too much, and has no crash resistance.

RihDB

A "Rust" re-implementation of my (not released) "not-invented-here" DB.

A work in progress.  Not a serious project.  Run "cargo test".

Its license right now is AGPLv3-only.  If you ask nicely, I might change it.

Right now this is a _very_ simple key value store library.  All data must fit in
memory, and all the files are loaded at startup (which could be slow!).  There
is no history compaction, so disk storage might be proportional to the total
number of writes you've done.

It stores Strings (which are unicode monsters) instead of something sensible
like byte-slices.  Sorry.
